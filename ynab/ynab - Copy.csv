We plan on continuing to pay all expenses jointly during the separation, with each getting an allowance and any income aboveallowances/joint expenses going into the common fund to be divided later (what used to be our Emergency Fund).

Method & Budgeting,9,0,2020-06-12 08:42:00,16,"The monthly goal (not monthly contribution) says, AMonthlygoal allows you to set an amount to budget and spend up to each month. For example, set a goal to budget $500 for groceries each month and spend up to $500 in a month.If you don't spend all of your budgeted funds in the current month, the remaining amount will contribute to the next month's goal when the month rolls over.   I want to use this for things like groceries. This seems to be the ideal solution when you get paid at the beginning of the month. Budget $500 for groceries, and anything you don't spend carries over to your goal for next month. If you have $50 left, you don't need to budget the full $500 next month, just the remaining $450.   But I can't figure out how to use this goal when I start budgeting ahead a month or more. If I receive my paycheck in June and click forward to July to apply money to July's budget/monthly goal, it doesn't know how much I'll have left over from Juneso it wants me to budget the full $500. But on the last day of June I've only spent $450 of my $500 budget/monthly goal, so $50 rolls forward to the July goalwhich is now over funded by $50. The net result is the monthly goal is no different than a monthly contribution goal.   Is there any way to take advantage of the monthly goal and have it behave like a monthly goal (not a monthly contribution) while still budgeting ahead a month or more?",How do I budget ahead with monthly goals?,jeremiahmercier,151
Accounts & Transactions,3,0,2020-06-14 01:07:00,6,"Hi folks! I've been having this issue for about a week, and I was wondering if anyone else had encountered this and found a quick fix.   I like to manually enter my transactions as they happen, then match them once they come in via direct import. This usually happens automatically, even if the payee names are a bit different and the dates are a few days off. A few weeks ago, I had a few pop up where they didn't match automatically, but it was no problem - I could just select the manually entered transaction and the imported transaction, click edit, then click match, and everything would be fine. But now I'm having issues to the point that YNAB won't even recognize matching transactionson the exact same date. The full payee names above are Payment: Credit - Chase Bank and Debit For Chase Credit Card EPay [#####]. This payee has always matched with my YNAB category for this card without issue. I've tried selecting the two transactions to manually match them, but the match option is greyed out.   This is also happening for transactions with dates that are a day or so off, or payee names that don't match as closely as the above example (but have definitely matched w/o problems in YNAB before). I just wanted to include the above example, as I really just can't figure out why it won't recognize it - it's recognized those payments for at least four months now, even if the dates are a few days apart.   Thanks folks! Greatly appreciate any insight y'all can offer.",Issues with transaction matching,Epphonehome,49

Method & Budgeting,5,1,2020-06-13 11:45:00,7,"Hi there,    Relatively new to YNAB. My wife and I work full time and have significant savings goals in mind. It just so coincidentally happens that we can almost entirely cover our monthly spending with one of our incomes. The other income can entirely go to the savings budget category that we have set up.    My initial thought was to do what is generally recommended: all income gets tagged as to be budgeted. I then create a target goal within a budget category and move the excess tbb to our savings category. On the other hand, my wife is suggesting that my income (which is the excess income mentioned in the first paragraph) be moved to the savings budget category directly when it appears in our checking account. That is, my bi-weekly wage line item in my checking account gets directly tagged with the savings budget category instead of being tagged as to-be-budgeted and then given a jobin a following step. In theory, this is similar to how we process refunds in a spending category. The refund transaction doesn't go to to-be-budgeted, but goes to credit the spending category where the associated spending transaction took place.    I can't think of a reason why my wife's approach is incorrect. Am I missing something if we did it this way?

I do not carry a balance on either of these cards and everything was correct a couple of weeks ago. All accounts are reconciled and I have no negative category balances or over budgeting.

Announcements,41,5,2020-04-21 01:43:00,122,"Hello YNABers! :)   I hope this announcement finds you safe and healthy!   In the coming days, we’ll be making a few changes to Direct Import. This will impact bank connections for some YNABers, so we wanted to give a quick outline of what’s happening and what’s to be expected.   Quovo, our primary direct import partner, was acquired by an industry-leader, Plaid. Starting this week, some YNABers will see a notification in YNAB asking to update the bank connections. For the most part, this will be like the first time you linked your accounts, and you’ll see an in-app message with some extra (hopefully helpful!) prompts to walk you through it.   We’re hoping to give you some time to make this transition, so your existing connections will continue to import transactions until May 21st. After May 21st, transaction imports will be paused until you update. Once you receive the notification to update, other actions like adding a new connection, and editing an existing connection, will require you to update.   These changes won’t apply to all YNABers, but we wanted to make an announcement about it so you know this is expected and how to reach our support team for help. If you have any trouble with these changes, please fill out the Direct Import form and our team will help you get things on track!",Upcoming Changes to Direct Import,Faness_YNAB,2445

Community Challenges,365,101,2019-12-31 03:20:00,2572,"Welcome to the Official* 2020 Debt Smackdown!   Happy new year everyone!   That's right, we're back for 2020. Last year we saw about 310 of us brutally destroyabout$3 million in debt.Wow. Right. Massive achievement. Can anyone say 'YNAB blog post'?   But there are plenty of us with still some debt to go. And asmuch as I hate debt, I do love a good spreadsheet, so here we go. A few of us have come into 2020 with some debt remaining. Maybe over spent at Christmas. Either way, this challenge is open to anyone who wants to eradicate that debt from your life. So what's this about? If you are holding onto some debt as you enter 2020- and would like to get rid of it - this challenge is for you. To the participants from last year, welcome back! For some of us, our total debts are too large to smack down completely in one calendar year, so if you're here from last year, congratulations on your progress and let's keep on doing this! In 2019, we collectively paid down over $2,800,000 in debt! An increase of OVER $1,300,000 than in 2018! For all new participants, we are happy to have you join in this year! New blood is always welcome. Let's all motivate each other to pay off those debts and continue moving forward to financial freedom.   How it works:   1. List the amount of total debt that you owe. This step is to give you an awareness of your current debt situation. Feel free to share, this forum is a safe and nonjudgmental place. You can also decide to keep this information private, you don't have to post your total here if you are not comfortable doing so. 2. Post in this thread the total amount of debt you would like to pay off during the 2020calendar year.(This part is required.) Feel free to break down the amounts by credit card/type of debt. Also, if you have a specific plan or some ideas on how you plan to pay down the debt, you can post that too. Maybe your plan will spark some ideas for others on how to tackle their own debts! 3. Check in monthly in this thread and report on how your debt smackdown is going.(This part is required.) 4. Post monthly on the2020Google Sheetto track your progress.(This part is required.) Claim a line on the spreadsheet, and post your total debt to be paid off, and the monthly amount that you send off towards it. Some people track their total payments and don't account for interest, some people account for principal only. The method you choose is up to you! If you come across this challenge later in the year, no worries, you can still jump right in. Just put zeroes in the months where youhad not joined the challenge yet, and start in the month you join in.   Last year, we collectively paid off $2,800,000. Let's smash that number again in 2020!  Please let me know any issues with the sheet - sometimes things are a bit wonky when making new ones!   *Official in the sense that there's a spreadsheet.

Accounts & Transactions,4,0,2020-06-16 03:45:00,5,"So I recently read that all inflow should be categorized into TBB (except refunds, reimbursements, or rebates ) so that your Income vs. Expense report wouldn't be thrown off. This makes sense to me now since my Income vs. Expense report wasn't an accurate representation of our true income and expenses when I was categorizing the money straight into a specific category.   My question is: Now that I'm putting all inflows into TBB and then putting the money into a specific category, how do I see where that money came from when since it doesn't show up as Activity but rather just Budgeted?   For example, if I received $ from both grandparents for my son for his birthday, say $25 from G1 and $30 from G2 for a total of $55 into TBB then into the Birthday category,how would I know from looking at the Budget where the $55 came from if it onlyshows in the Budgeted category.   As opposed to if I had categorized the money straight into the Birthday category, then I could look at Activity and it would show where the money came from ($25 from G1 and $30 from G2).   Am I doing something incorrect, or is this a result of putting the money into TBB and then giving it a job?
