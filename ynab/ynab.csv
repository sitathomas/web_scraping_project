Investing & Retirement,,21 hrs ago,,2,"I currently have several taxable investing accounts. One is saving for a car. I am curious if there is a way to use a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) in YNAB to save on taxes. . Here is what I am thinking.   Let's say it's time to purchase a $5,000 car. Since we regularly give a 10% tithe to our church, I could take $5,000 from our investment portfolio and put it in a DAF to avoid capital gains. After, when I get paid I could take the 10% that we would normally give to the church, set it aside for savings, and take that amount out of our DAF and send it to the church. It would take several months to recoup all of the fund, but with enough planning we could avoid the Capital gains. I would essentially setup a budgeted account in YNAB to track it all.Any thoughts?",Donor Advised Fund,Navy_Blue_Yeti_7,3
Accounts & Transactions,,21 hrs ago,,4,"I have a transaction in my checking account register that is currently listed (via the payee column) as being a transfer to a linked savings account. I wantedto unlink the savings account, and change the payee in the checking account so it is no longer a transfer, that way I can categorize it (and budget for it). However, in the process of trying to unlink the savings account, I somehow managed to delete the transfer from the savings account register, and now I can't get it back.   Nowthe transaction in the checking account register is locked, because I think YNAB wants me to change the payee column in the savings register. But the transaction is no longer visible in my savings register, so I can't change it. Basically, I have an orphan transfer in my checking account, which is LOCKED because it's linked with a now-disappeared transaction in my savings account that I want to unlink.

Managing Debt,,19 hrs ago,,24,"Hello,   I have a question about credit card debt. Could you please tell me if the following steps are correct?   1. I added a credit card account in the budget section (and not the tracking section) and its total balance.   Let's say - 5000$ for Visa.   2. In the credit card payments category, appears the name of the Visa account. Now, in that category, do I budget for the total amount Visa will take from my account (150$) at the end of the month, OR do I put the real amount I'm paying towards the amount I owe to Visa (100), and budget for the interests (50) separately in another category I create?   3. Arrives the day when Visa takes the money from my account: do I record that transaction as it is, or do I split it in two? (100$ and 50$ of interest). OR do I transfer the 100€ to the Visa account, and record the interests as a regular expense?   Thanks a lot for your clarification! Still learning.   All the best,",Question about a credit card account,acidbahia,5
App Functions,8,7,,79,"A steady stream of YNAB improvements for your reading pleasure.   ** For Release Notes pre-dating January 2019, grab your study specs, put the kettle on, and settle in over here.     Web Release Notes: January 3, 2019     Auto-categorizing to Credit Card Payment categories is no longer an option in Manage Payees. It didn’t work anyway, it just created uncategorized transactions. PSA: Categorize credit card spending to the category it was budgeted for (e.g.groceries) and we’llautomaticallymove money from the spending category (again, groceries) to the credit card payment category. The payment recommendation text in the credit card account inspector was removed. It wasn’t very helpful. It is sorry, and will go to its room and think about what it’s done. If you’re logged into YNAB and purchase a gift subscription with a different credit card than your current subscription, your upcoming renewal now shows this new card will be charged. It didn’t before, but our payment system uses the latest credit card info.   Web Release Notes: January 8, 2019  If you used “Enter Now” for a scheduledsplitthen changed back to the originally scheduled date, you could end up with duplicate splits in some situations. We fixed that. If you tried linking theAlexa Skillfrom an iOS 11 device, you would end up on the My Account screen, mysteriously. That’s not right so we fixed it. It’s actually an upstream bug, but it’s relatively easy enough for us to work around in our code. We used to allow imported transactions to be matched with balance adjustments and starting balance transactions. That’s wrong so we stopped doing it. We fixed a bug where a scheduled transfer from a credit card account to a tracking account would not correctly show up as an upcoming transaction in the quick budget section of the budget inspector nor change the category to orange. All better now. Fixed a rare issue with linking accounts and downloading transactions.   APINEWS   We had some issues with how we were handling the month URL segment. It only worked when you passed in the first of the month (e.g.2018-12-01) Otherwise, you’d get an error. Now you can pass in any valid day of the month (e.g.2018-12-17) and we’ll handle it properly. If you pass in an invalid value for the month URL segment, we’ll return a more helpful error:    HTTP 400 Bad Request { error: { id: 400, name: bad_request, detail: invalid date } }   Web Release Notes: January 10, 2019  APINEWS   The API now supports matching when creating transactions. If you specify animport_id, we’ll attempt to match an existing user-entered (i.e.not imported) transaction, just like we do for Linked accounts. Woot.   Web Release Notes: January 15, 2019  Page titles got some love. They’re more reflective of what’s happening on a given page (e.g.“Income v Expense Report | [Budget Name] | YNAB”). Bookmark them all, then brag to your friends. We recently pushed up some changes to ‘Enter Now’ to prevent it from duplicating sub-transactions in rare situations. Unfortunately, those changes inadvertently broke Enter Now for people who had already used it for a scheduled date and later deleted the transaction. It’s now working as you would expect: If you delete a transaction created by a previous use of Enter Now, then use Enter Now again, we’ll create another transaction. A while back we addressed some issues with Spending Reports, particularly how we handle net positive spending, where a category group has more inflows than outflows for a particular month. Unfortunately, we missed the mark a bit, causing some confusion. Now we plot net inflows (asnegativevalues), and you can more clearly see how all the numbers add up.   APINews   PATCHis now supported on the/budgets/:id/transactionscollection to allow bulk updates. Also,import_idcan be passed in lieu ofidto update an existing transaction with thatimport_id. Updated a few error responses for consistency.   Web Release Notes: January 17, 2019  When deleting a transfer transaction with the other side being a split transaction, we failed to delete the other side’s sub-transactions. Fixed now. When entering an invalid date in the register, we would continue to display the invalid value while behind the scenes we would use the last valid value. That was confusing so now we’re making it more transparent and reverting the invalid value as soon as you leave the field.     Web Release Notes: January 22, 2019    • IE11 browsers and earlier versions of Edge were choking on the Spending Totals report. As a result, we don’t display sum totals in those browsers. Recent versions of Edge handle the report well so we now show the sum totals in Edge, just like all the other browsers. Except IE11, which is still (and forever will be) broken.   APINews •Delta Requestson the/budgets/{id}/transactionsendpoint now include any tombstoned sub-transactions, if they were tombstoned sincelast_knowledge_of_server.   Web Release Notes: January 24, 2019  Fixed an issue where scheduled payments from one credit account to another were not correctly calculating the “Budget for Upcoming” Quick Budget amount nor properly updating the payment category Available balance warning. Again, fixed now. Fixed an edge case scenario that could prevent credentials from being retrieved or submitted when troubleshooting existing Direct Import connections.   Web Release Notes: January 29, 2019 APINews  • The endpoints to listaccounts,categories,payees, andmonthsall now supportdelta requests. If you’re looking for speed and efficiency, deltas are the way to go.   Web Release Notes: January 31, 2019  Chrome v72 (the latest as of this writing) choked on our pristine CSS (UI styling rules), preventing users from scrolling to the bottom of the register. Fixed now.   Web Release Notes: February 5, 2019  Only small internal changes today (e.g.CSS maintenance; humans.txt updates). Mostly setting the stage for future updates. Nothing else to report.   Web Release Notes: February 7, 2019  You can now collapse individual split transactions. We unified the two sidebar menus. The one-menu-to-rule-them-all now lives at the top left corner. Para sa aming mga kaibigan sa Pilipinas, ang amingkasanayan sa Alexangayon ay nagsasalita ng mga piso! For our Filipino friends, ourAlexa skillnow speaks pesos! When Fresh Starting with scheduled credit card payments, we would miscalculate “Budget for Upcoming” and not show an underfunded alert. Fixed now. We figured out how to get reordering accounts in MS Edge working.    Web Release Notes: February 11, 2019  A lot of stuff going out today, but it’s behind-the-scenes maintenance and security stuff, so we don’t have much to talk about here. Have a great week. (We’re rooting for you!)    Web Release Notes: February 14, 2019  Once again we find ourselves announcing a maintenance and security release. Not very flashy, as release notes go, but important nonetheless. Good luck with the end of the week. I hope it’s all down hill from here.   Web Release Notes: February 19, 2019 NEW (AND EXCITING)  Scheduled transactions are a great way to automate your budget. Just set and forget. Until months later when you forget that you set and transactions seem to appear mysteriously. So to improve visibility, you can now collapse your scheduled transactions.   Web Release Notes: February 21, 2019  When looking at your scheduled transactions and using the ‘Enter Now’ feature, we’ll create the new transaction and shift focus to it. We used to create the transaction but maintain focus on the scheduled transaction that spawned it. Mobile only: Fixed an awkwardly large scroll area at the bottom of the Add Account and connection management screens on mobile. The connection status oflinked accountsis now more obvious. In rare situations, deleting a category would not work. You click ‘Delete’ and nothing happens. Now it will delete the category. Jumping from the budget’s ‘Activity’ popup to a specific transaction in the register could cause a crash if the target transaction was a collapsed split. Now we simply expand the split.   Web Release Notes: February 26, 2019  When we import transactions from your bank, the “payee” field undergoes a fair amount of processing. First, we have to clean it up from its raw form, then we apply yourpayee renaming rules. We show the fully processed payee (i.e.cleansed and renamed) in the register. If you mouse over that, the tooltip will show you thecleansedversion. And if you really want to see the original payee as provided by your bank, you can follow the “bank import details” link at the bottom of the payees dropdown, and there, in all its unrefined glory, you’ll find your “Sale AMZN Mktp US*MI5DF8ZV1” payee. We fixed the currency ISO code for the current Azerbaijan Manat (its 3rd incarnation, if you’re counting). We originally had it as AZM, but everyone knows it’s supposed to be AZN as of the beginning of 2006. Apologies to beloved Azerbaijani and Turkmen YNABers, and thanks for gently correcting us.   Web Release Notes: February 28, 2019  Sorry, not much to report today. Just maintenance and security bits. Important, but dull. That’s it. I yield back the balance of my time to the Chair.    Web Release Notes: March 5, 2019  Direct Import: We fixed an issue where some transactions from different linked accounts could incorrectly import into the account being added or linked. Move Money now shows available amounts from the currently selected budget month, rather than the current calendar month. The status of iTunes Subscriptions through Apple shows more accurate and detailed information underMy Account. Not that it was wrong before, but it’s much richer now. You can now import transactions across all your linked accounts in the web app using the notification under “All Accounts”. It will include the grand total number of transactions available to import, approve, or categorize, and clicking the notification will trigger the import of available transactions, if any, while also filtering the list to display only those transactions. You may now import with reckless abandon. The Turkish Lira becomes a first-class citizen as we now use its symbol, ₺, instead of our inauspicious placeholder, TL. Budget-category-group checkboxes better reflect the state of their constituent sub-categories. It’s now more obvious when you have all, some, or no sub-categories selected for a given category group, whether that group is expanded or collapsed. If you had any categories selected in your budget, then expanded or collapsed their category group (or just clicked the empty space in a category group row), we mistakenly de-selected your categories. Fixed now. We’re now taking a more gentle approach to notify you of new releases, this present release notwithstanding.Going forward we’ll pop up a little message to give you the option to “refresh” your browser immediately to get the new bits, or hold off on the update so you can finish whatever task is at hand. Regardless of your choice there, we also have an easy link to these very release notes, which may be the single most important item in this entire list. You can tell because it comes at the end, when most people have already given up reading. (If youarereading this bullet point in its entirety, please read it a second time to make up for all the people that punched out early. Thx.)  APINews  We now explicitly designate theformat(int32orint64) ofintegertypes inour OpenAPI spec. This change to the spec has no practical implications forour Javascript SDKandRuby SDK, neither of which needed updating subsequent to this change. However, if you’re generating your own client library and your language of choice distinguishes between integer types, it’s time to update.        Web Release Notes: March 7, 2019  Escaping from the transaction editor duringreconciliationwould flat out cancel reconciliation. Now it just closes the transaction editor, allowing reconciliation to continue apace.   Web Release Notes: March 7, 2019 — 2nd edition  Quick update to fix some minor display issues with the last release.    Web Release Notes: March 12, 2019  Some of you might not know this, butYNAB is great at importing transaction files downloaded from your bank. This is really helpful when your bank doesn’t support directly connecting to it, or the connection is having trouble. Now that we’re all on the same page, you should know that we improved the way we import dates and times for files that end in .ofx or .qfx. Now we take the time into account and not just the date, which means that your transactions are more likely to fall on the correct date when they’re imported. When linking to your bank account, we could sometimes show a really cryptic error message that started with “Missing translation” and got worse from there. No more! Sometimes, when we hit a snag while importing transactions from your bank, we will keep trying in the background, and all you have to do is wait a bit for things to catch up. But when that would happen, we would previously make it look all “doom and gloom” and put an error icon in your sidebar. Now we will correctly tell you that the syncing is merely “delayed”. When importing from your bank, there was a rare scenario that could cause the same transaction to get imported twice. It was confusing, so we fixed it. When importing from your bank, there was a rare scenario that could cause the same transaction to get imported twice. It was confusing, so we fixed it. If you’re looking at your budgets list, you can now still create a new budget directly from the menu in the upper left corner even though there is already a “create new budget” button in the list of budgets. We made some improvements to the way we tell you about your goals.  Added “Started” month/year Added the goal type in the title so that you know what kind of goal it is. We dropped the “s” from “GOALS” because that “s” was silly. P.S. Indented bullet lists are difficult to format.    APINews (for you developers out there):  You can now use insecure redirect URIs for localhost (e.g. http://localhost:3000) with your OAuth Applications using the Authorization Code Grant Flow. Previously we’d require that you redirect to https://localhost:3000 for local testing, which required a lot of annoying hoop jumping and certificate management. Hat tip to @kordonme for the request!      Web Release Notes: March 14, 2019  In rare cases, the columns on the account register that cannot be resized (checkbox, flag, cleared) could become smaller than they should be. Once they got out of whack, there was no way to resize them back to the size should be. They are now at the correct size no matter what you do. When you first start YNAB, we will helpfully start pointing you to certain parts of the budget screen and instructing you how to budget and move money around. But as it turns out, if you collapsed Category Groups before these instructions appear, we had no idea where to point you and would end up pointing these instructions to places that didn’t make sense. It was an especially embarrassing mistake for us because if you were seeing these instructions, you were likely new to YNAB. I’m relieved to tell you that we have wiped the proverbial egg from our face and have fixed the issue.      Web Release Notes: March 19, 2019  When creating a category in the register, if you used the keyboard it would accidentally create the category twice. Now it only creates a single category as expected. When changing a budget’s name, the browser’s title wasn’t updating. Fixed! When transferring from one Budget Account to another, using tab to select a Transfer Payee was moving the cursor into the Category field. YNAB doesn’t even allow you to categorize transfers between Budget Accounts, so that wasn’t helpful. Now hitting tab will skip directly the Memo field instead. Keyboard selection in the account register is back to normal, we had a bug where you couldn’t select rows across the regular transaction section and the scheduled transaction section. You can now type “split” into the category dropdown to automatically select the ability to split the transaction. Or “s” or “Sp” or “sPL” or “SPLit” I think you get the point…       Web Release Notes: March 21, 2019  Several behind the scenes changes today, including some preparation for an exciting new feature! Have a great end of the week.         Web Release Notes: March 26, 2019  Creating a new category from the category field of a new or existing transaction by clicking “Add Category”, then “Save” did nothing and no new category was created. That was sub-optimal, so we fixed it. Now it creates the new category. TheIncome v Expense Reportnow remembers your expanded and collapsed rows. This was our intention all along, but we wrote a bug that broke it when we converted some related code from CoffeeScript to TypeScript. To our credit, the bug was type safe. If you navigated from one side of atransfer transactionto another, and that other side happened to be a collapsedsplit transaction, the app would hang. :sadtrombone: Now you’ll see the expanded split. :lightheartedpiccolo:  APINews  TheAPI Endpoints documentationhas long given you the ability to quickly and easily query your data. (All you need is a simplepersonal access tokenfor authentication.) We’ve tweaked the validation rules forUUIDs to prevent some false-positive validation failures. Most notably, we now supportlast-usedfor IDs, where appropriate.       Web Release Notes: March 28, 2019  For the armchair grammarians among us, we now refer to your age of money as being “1 day” instead of “1 days.” I’m not sure how it could, but if this issue resurfaces, there’s atried and true workaround.  APINews  Thanks to the generosity of Taryn Phrohdoh we now have anAPI client library written in Rust. You can check out all the client libraries—official and community-supported—in theAPI documentation. The documentation for our response toGET /budgetsrequests was incomplete. Each budget summary object also includesfirst_monthandlast_monthdates. Those dates represent the earliest and latest budget months, respectively. The docs now make that clear. We no longer choke on unsupported Unicode escape sequences in the request payload. Now we returnHTTP 400and error detail. Fixed an issue where some transaction payees were nullified when importing multiple transactions in a single API request. Moral of the story: always reset your loop variables. TheGET /transactionsendpoint wasn’t returning split transactions that had been converted to non-splits. Now it does.        Web Release Notes: April 2, 2019  What’s New   We now store your filter, search, and sort order settings for the “All Accounts” view on a per-budget basis. Modifying filter, search, and/or sort order settings for one budget’s “All Accounts” view won’t affect those settings in any of your other budgets.  APINews  When responding to delta requests for/categories, we weren’t considering theserver_knowledgeof some of the entities related to a given category’s monthly budget. Essentially we weren’t considering changes to activity or balance amounts when deciding which categories had changed since a givenlast_knowledge_of_server. Now we do and you get a more accurate view of categories’ changed states.   Web Release Notes: April 4, 2019  Scheduledsplit transactionscomprisingtransfersub-transactions needed some attention. The split side didn’t provide a link to the other side, and if you clicked on the link from the other side, it crashed.LOL. Fixed now.   Web Release Notes: April 5, 2019  If you had an account register search saved from before ourApril 2 release, we would reuse that search when you came back to the account register, even if you had cleared it. It might have even made you say to yourself, “wait…”. Well, fret not, it’s fixed now. Have a great weekend.   Web Release Notes: April 9, 2019  We’ve added a “finishes” date toTarget Category Balance by Date goalprogress. Now you can easily see when your goal will be finished, which wasn’t quite as discoverable before. In certain cases when importing large numbers of transactions, the logic could go off the rails, incorrectly matching or not matching other transactions. Fixed now. In arecent change, we improved how your search is saved. This caused a new bug where the old bug would reappear if you cleared out your search, once again putting you in a situation where you could never really clear your search. We’re gonna call this one “fixed” again and hope it sticks. In rare cases, the list of accounts was ordered differently in the Payee dropdown for individual transactions compared to the main list of accounts on the left. Now they are both ordered like the main list of accounts on the left.    Web Release Notes: April 11, 2019  A somewhat disappointing release today insofar as there is little to talk about. All internal stuff, nothing user-facing.   In an effort to stretch it out just a little bit longer, here’s a rough breakdown of the kinds of things we shipped, along with their relative number of updates:   3x internal tooling (primarily to support our beloved support folks) 2x increase direct import efficiency 1x shore up Apple subscription plumbing 2x paying down technical debt 2x performance improvements 1x remove now-obsolete workarounds 1x prep server for mobile bug fix 1x prep for upcoming feature      Web Release Notes: April 16, 2019  We now disable the Undo/Redo buttons while you’re editing a transaction. Once you’re done editing, we reenable them. When deleting a Category Group, sometimes you’d have to click Undo/Redo multiple times. Now a single click does the job. Much like we reported in the critically acclaimedApril 9 release notes, we found another case where the list of accounts was ordered differently in the Payee dropdown for individual transactions compared to the main list of accounts on the left. Now that one’s fixed, too. Keeping with the theme… The Account list in Edit > Move to Account menu was sometimes ordered differently than the sidebar. Now they’re consistent. When viewing transactions for a particular payee in the manage-payee popover, we sometimes we displayed internal, non-displayable transactions. We don’t do that any more.  APINews  Updated docs to include validation requirements for creating/updating transactions. Fixed a typo in an error message we hope you’ll never see.     Web Release Notes: April 18, 2019  If you have a javascript disabled in your browser, the app won’t work well, if at all. We’re usually pretty good at detecting when it’s disabled and showing a lovingly crafted message asking you to re-enable javascript so we can carry on. Except for some pages in theMy Accountarea. Things would just break and look weird, with no lovingly crafted message telling you what’s going on. We’ve now extended the coverage of the twice aforementioned lovingly crafted message to include the My Account pages. If you selected “Make Recurring” for the date of an existing transaction, we were so eager to create your scheduled transaction we forgot to save any changes you may have made to the transaction you just made recurring. Now we save your changes, then go about creating the scheduled transaction. Improved CSS loading performance, which improves app loading performance, which improves perceived loading time. I mean, if we’re being honest.          Web Release Notes: April 23, 2019  We’ve updated the login/signup flows, unifying the look and feel across platforms. Along with refreshing the design, we’ve improved security and prepared the code for more significant updates in the future. If you tried to change a Monthly Funding goal to be Target Balance by Date, on rare occasions we would delete it instead of saving it. Fixed now.    Web Release Notes: April 25, 2019  Only performance and security updates going out today. If it’s any consolation, I find that just as boring as you. But let’s not dwell in the past.[cue inspirational music]Let us, instead, lookforwardto the undiscovered wonders of next week’s release notes…    Web Release Notes: May 7, 2019  Just a maintenance release today, and a small one at that. We just got back from our annual retreat yesterday (it was wonderful), so I suspect we’ll have more to talk about here later this or early next week. Hope you’re having a great week.    Web Release Notes: May 9, 2019  A little bit ago we regaled you withnewsof our unifying the login/signup flows. In our excitement we forgot to put the “keep me logged in” checkbox on the revamped login screen. If that doesn’t ring a bell, it used to be called “remember me”. Whatever you call it, it’s back where it belongs. Fixed a crash when Apple subscribers try to resubscribe after their subscription has expired.  APINews  Thanks to Andre Bocchini’s generous work we now have aSwift API clientfor iOS/macOS/WatchOS/tvOS. Fittingly, we’ve added it to ourlist of community-supported libraries. The login/signup unification mentioned above accidentally broke the API OAuth Login process. This release fixes it.    Web Release Notes: May 14, 2019  We’ve improved the contrast on our category balance pills. With these changes, users with visual impairments will be able to use YNAB more easily. Accessibility FTW. Readtoday’s blog postto learn more.  APINews  We’ve increased the max length of the memo field from 100 to 200 when creating or updating transactions. We’ve updated thedocsaccordingly (be sure to click ‘Model’ under the ‘data’ section).    Web Release Notes: May 16, 2019  Fixed a login error with the latest version of Firefox. These are other items to give the illusion of more going on in this release. There are also maintenance and security fixes going out. But we don’t usually talk about those, so mum’s the word.    Web Release Notes: May 21, 2019  Today’s release is all sight unseen improvements. Among other (unseen) things we are releasing a change to our database that should significantly help move some database metrics in a positive direction. You likely won’t notice, but we will because it should make internal-chat messages like “Alert: 95th% Response Time High” or “Hey Taylor, are you seeing this strange behavior?” a thing of the past.   Web Release Notes: May 23, 2019  Sorry folks, more sight unseen improvements today. But, these type of changes keep YNAB running smoothly for your budgeting pleasure. Interesting fact: we removed more lines of code today than we added.   Web Release Notes: May 28, 2019  Just one noteworthy fix. If you have ever seen a $0.00 balance with a red color pill you might have been confused. We’ve fixed this rare scenario, which was caused by some rounding issues.High fives the other JavaScript developers.   Beyond that, a lot of behind the curtain lever pulls and button pushes, preparing for some upcoming features. What kinds of buttons and levers? Well, there was 4,247 lines worth of overhauled CSS, for starters. These changes should make our future efforts easier and faster, but you won’t notice anything different just yet.   Web Release Notes: May 30, 2019  Now as scheduled transactions become real life transactions, we will attempt to match them to any previously imported transaction. Even when using Enter Now from the Edit menu. Usually scheduled transactions will fire before their imported counterparts are imported but in some cases the imported one will beat it. This is especially true if you are using anAPI integrationthat offers near real-time importing of transactions. The UnderfundedQuick Budgetoption is now available when you’ve selected a single category that is either overspent, has a goal that hasn’t been funded yet or if you haven’t budgeted enough for an upcoming transaction.   Web Release Notes: June 4, 2019 APINews  Creating or updating splits through the API isn’t supported (yet) but you can update the parent transaction of an existing split. The only catch is you cannot change the date, amount, or category. We updated ourAPI docsto make this a tad clearer.   Web Release Notes: June 5, 2019  Fixed an issue with transactions for some accounts importing with payees likeU S Dollar,Canadian Dollar,British Pound, and the like, in the past couple of days. You might still see some lingering imported payees like that the next time you import, but going forward they should show up correctly like they used to.   Web Release Notes: June 6, 2019  We made small changes to make the overspent and underfunded category colors stand out a bit more, especially if you have a form of colorblindness. But if those don’t stand out quite enough for you, we also added an option in Account Settings to switch back to the Classic colors. Now you can decide which style works best for you.    Web Release Notes: June 11, 2019  Lots of under the covers updates to support some upcoming new features.  APINews  We updated our documentation to make it clear that theAPIdoesn’t yet support creating or updating scheduled transactions.    Web Release Notes: June 13, 2019  Fixed an error that could prevent loading the app on IE11. Updated some build dependencies, keeping up with the latest and greatest out there. We are currently testing some under the hood changes to decrease database load and improve performance.    Web Release Notes: June 18, 2019  When adding a transaction, if you changed your mind and clicked on some other transaction, we’d always force you to cancel adding the transaction first. Now, if you have made no changes, we’ll just dismiss without asking to cancel. Because we’re cool with changing our minds. (If you made any changes to the transaction though, we’ll still ask you to cancel, just in case.) When adding a transaction, you could click the Needs Category notification icon on another transaction to begin unintentionally editing it. Oops, not anymore. When searching for a sub-transaction of a split, the collapse split button will no longer appear giving you the impression you can collapse a partially shown split, because you really can’t do that. Fixed a layout issue when adding accounts on large tablet screens.    Web Release Notes: June 20, 2019  In Firefox we were unintentionally sorting by category when you were trying to resize a category column, we fixed that. We’re smarter about which default dates we recommend when your make a transaction recurring depending on the frequency.   Web Release Notes: June 25, 2019  On the Net Worth report, months far in the past could get hidden, so we added a vertical scrollbar to the report so that we aren’t hiding such valuable data anymore. While using shift + arrows to select multiple transactions in the register, if you reached the bottom and hit the down arrow one more time, it used to error but now it doesn’t. We even fixed using the up arrow to unselect transactions too. We even made you a silent film to show you what we are talking about. Besides the two afore-mentioned items, we merged another 10 “pull requests”/”units” of work, but they are all marked as “internal”, meaning that we don’t normally talk about them here. But the author of these release notes thinks that is selling them short, so I’m going to talk about a few of them anyway! The technical folks reading this might appreciate that we:  Made it easier for our support teams to map a financial institution from one aggregation provider to another. Fixed grammar/punctuation on a message related to expired password tokens. Disabled reCAPTCHA when running automated tests. (It was easier than trying to trick Google into thinking our automated tests were human.) Removed tracing from the iOS proxy generator templates. (That sounds too cool not to include it.) Upgraded toTypescript 3.5.1and upgradedRSVPto version 4.8.5. Migrated toYarn Workspaces. (We are big fans of this approach after having only used it a few days.) Fixed some issues with ourDockerdevelopment environment.     Web Release Notes: June 27, 2019  For those of you using Safari or Firefox, you may have noticed a few wonky spacing issues when scrolling in the account settings area. We tidied up the margins so you can now scroll with adequate spacing. PS – If you haven’t visited the settings area in a while, this could be your excuse to check it out! There’s lots of fun things to do—link your Google account,update your billing info,give the gift of YNAB, and so much more! If you’ve been relying on Chrome to autofill your password, the login button would sometimes stay disabled after the email and password were autofilled, which wasn’t very helpful given that you probably set up that autofill to save yourself time! This is now fixed and you can get back to automating-all-the-things. 🎉  APINews  We did a little bit of housekeeping on the YNAB API this week…   (actual footage from our API dev team over the last few days)   OAuth applications now supportdefault budget selectionso you can ask users for a default budget when authorizing and then pass in “default” in lieu of a budget_id in API endpoint calls, making things simpler in a few cases. A fewDelta Requestimprovements:  Delta request on /budgets/{budget_id}/accounts endpoint will now return accounts that have had balance changes The /months/{month} endpoint now returns server_knowledge.   Marked transfer_transaction_id and matched_transaction_id as strings rather than uuid in ourAPI spec.",Release Notes,ynab_janelle,7904
App Functions,8673,Status,,100,"I would love to be able to reconcile my accounts in the mobile app.   For context, I use the mobile app primarily. I like to reconcile my accounts at the end of the month - specifically my investment tracking accounts. Reconciling is the easiest way to add an adjustment transaction for the amount the account went up or down. Since I’m not always at home on the last day of the month, it would be super helpful to be able to do this easily from my phone.   Currently I have to use the calculator app to calculate the difference, and then create a new transaction for that difference. Trying to remember all those balances while switching apps is a pain and prone to error.   Even better would be a manual “Reconcile Tracking Account” button that would reach out to the connected bank account and make an adjustment based on the difference in balances. This would still be a manual step, so it would force us to stay involved with these accounts, but it would avoid the trouble of remembering the balance while switching apps.

YNAB Wins,5,11,,9,"My wife and I started YNAB 2 months ago and at that time we had about $900 in credit card debt from summer vacations we couldn’t afford to take and an “emergency fund”savings account with a little less than one month’s income in it.   We started working the program and it was super frustrating that we had to budget 5x a month when our paychecks arrived.   So, at the end of September,I paid myself a little extra out of my business and topped up our “Emergency Fund” to be one month of income. I then relabeled the “Emergency Fund” as “30-Day Buffer.”   That means for October, we’ll simply use the 30-Day Buffer to budget completely once at the beginning of the month. Then, we’ll collect our paychecks in a category called “Next Month’s Budget.”   It’s crazy how looking at the same financial picture from a different angle totally changes how it feels.   On the one hand, I’m pumped that we’re buffered and REALLY know whether we can afford things (bye bye personal trainer and HBO.)   On the other hand, one month of buffer is still pretty scary to me since my self-employee income can be erratic. Sure it’s better than being in debt but 30-days is a short amount of time in the scheme of things. Being buffered has made me realize what I need to feel secure. I’m sure that’s different for everyone. It’s at least 90-days is buffer AND an Emergency Fund. I’m sure that sounds crazy to some and like not enough for others.   Anyway, this little switchhas been really eye opening and I highly encourage any of you with Emergency Funds to try it out.

Saving,,5 hrs ago,,7,"For others using savings accounts as well as Investment Money Market Accounts (Like the Vanguard VMFXX/VMMXX), how do you determine the the balance of your funds between the two?   My understanding is that your Savings account is safer and has a consistent interest rate (until the Fed changes things and the banks change again of course), while the MMF CAN have a higher rate of return (but not necessarily since they're based one market conditions etc.). It seems both have pretty similar level of access to the funds (a couple days to transfer from either to a checking account if needed - although some bills can be paid directly from a savings account, which I do for most of my credit cards currently).   So I'm wondering what the general strategy is for determining what portion of your funds to keep in what location - percentage? money for certain long term goals? certain amount?.   I'm nowhere near really needing to consider this deeply yet (don't even have $3k in my Vanguard account yet to switch to VMMXX), but I'm trying to get ideas for when I have more funds sitting around and waiting for use (i.e. when I'm saving a car payment every month instead of spending it).",Savings account vs Investment Money Market Fund - How much where?,techiem2,4

Saving,14,1,,47,"New to YNAB, about 3 months. Am really struggling with too many savings categories v debt. I end up spreading thin to meet them all, and not making real progress.   My furnace is starting to get iffy. Had a quote of $7k, by a company upselling me who I no longer trust. It needed cleaning, not replacing.   I have started a furnace fund, because eventually it wont be bs. (Really, you are going to pull that on a mechanical engineer who works at the gas company?) Atmy current rate of contribution it will take 5 years, assuming that price is ball park.   For debt, I snowball. Pay off 1, then add that payment to the next. etc. I will have paid off the next debt in less than a year. Then there is the next one, but that will take longer.   So am realizing I am inclined to pay off debt above everything. I hates it. At the expense of things that will be needed, like the furnace fund.   Tips for getting over myself?

API & Integrations,8,4,,7,"Hi all!   I've been using YNAB for a while now, I really like it but the biggest pain as it seems is dealing with multiple currencies. I tried the existing apps for this, but never really got used to it, as it only converted currencies once a day in the background, and I wanted to have the correct numbers in my budget right off the bat. So for a while, my solution for foreign currency spending has been typing it into google and then adding the converted amount to YNAB.   Recently I've been working on app that would save me the trip to google each time - basically an interface to convert currencies and add a transaction at the same time. I got it approved by YNAB today and want to share it with the community now. :)   Here's the link:https://cc.lisik.dev/   There is some more info on how to use it and how it's different on the home page.

Community Challenges,365,101,,2531,"Welcome to the Official* 2020 Debt Smackdown!   Happy new year everyone!   That's right, we're back for 2020. Last year we saw about 310 of us brutally destroyabout$3 million in debt.Wow. Right. Massive achievement. Can anyone say 'YNAB blog post'?   But there are plenty of us with still some debt to go. And asmuch as I hate debt, I do love a good spreadsheet, so here we go. A few of us have come into 2020 with some debt remaining. Maybe over spent at Christmas. Either way, this challenge is open to anyone who wants to eradicate that debt from your life. So what's this about? If you are holding onto some debt as you enter 2020- and would like to get rid of it - this challenge is for you. To the participants from last year, welcome back! For some of us, our total debts are too large to smack down completely in one calendar year, so if you're here from last year, congratulations on your progress and let's keep on doing this! In 2019, we collectively paid down over $2,800,000 in debt! An increase of OVER $1,300,000 than in 2018! For all new participants, we are happy to have you join in this year! New blood is always welcome. Let's all motivate each other to pay off those debts and continue moving forward to financial freedom.   How it works:   1. List the amount of total debt that you owe. This step is to give you an awareness of your current debt situation. Feel free to share, this forum is a safe and nonjudgmental place. You can also decide to keep this information private, you don't have to post your total here if you are not comfortable doing so. 2. Post in this thread the total amount of debt you would like to pay off during the 2020calendar year.(This part is required.) Feel free to break down the amounts by credit card/type of debt. Also, if you have a specific plan or some ideas on how you plan to pay down the debt, you can post that too. Maybe your plan will spark some ideas for others on how to tackle their own debts! 3. Check in monthly in this thread and report on how your debt smackdown is going.(This part is required.) 4. Post monthly on the2020Google Sheetto track your progress.(This part is required.) Claim a line on the spreadsheet, and post your total debt to be paid off, and the monthly amount that you send off towards it. Some people track their total payments and don't account for interest, some people account for principal only. The method you choose is up to you! If you come across this challenge later in the year, no worries, you can still jump right in. Just put zeroes in the months where youhad not joined the challenge yet, and start in the month you join in.   Last year, we collectively paid off $2,800,000. Let's smash that number again in 2020!  Please let me know any issues with the sheet - sometimes things are a bit wonky when making new ones!   *Official in the sense that there's a spreadsheet.
